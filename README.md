meloworld is my personal arch linux desktop. i've been working on it for a while now, just trying to fit everything to my taste and build a cozy and safe space out of it. "what is done in love, is done well"

## 🌸 features

<details>
<summary>🪟 bar & workspaces</summary>
<br>

![bar](assets/bar.png)
![bar light](assets/bar-light.png)

workspace pills slide in when you open something and slide out when you close it. scroll the mouse wheel to switch workspaces. all status pills on the right open their respective popups.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎄 launcher</summary>
<br>

![launcher](assets/launcher.png)
![launcher grid](assets/launcher-grid.png)
![clipboard](assets/clipboard.png)
![emoji](assets/emoji.png)
![wallpaper selector](assets/wallpaper-selector.png)

a custom launcher built in quickshell, with modes. aimed to replace rofi for more flexibility. also supports switcheroo-control (like gnome and cosmic). you can switch between modes with the prefixes. /h for hidden apps, /w for wallpapers, /g for grid-list view switch. wallpapers are pulled from ~/Pictures/Wallpapers, just drop yours in.

</details>

<details>
<summary>☀️ dashboard</summary>
<br>

![dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)

a left panel with quick toggles, system stats, and notification history. the greeting changes with the time of day.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🪴 popups</summary>
<br>

all animated — slide down from the top when they open, slide back up when they close. all share the same design language.

**🎼 media player**

![media player](assets/media.png)

supports shuffle and repeat on supported apps. uses the material expressive 3 progress bar. switches between players with arrows. also supports live streams.

---

**🔊 audio**

![audio popup](assets/audio.png)

device selection for output and input. volume and mic sliders side by side. click the icon to mute — everything dims when muted. single-device setups hide the selector automatically.

---

**🦷 bluetooth**

![bluetooth popup](assets/bluetooth.png)

paired devices, scan button, filtered scan list, no raw MAC addresses cluttering things up. list caps at five entries and scrolls — tells you when there's more above or below.

---

**🛜 wifi**

![wifi popup](assets/wifi.png)

previously connected networks, autoscan, password entry. same scrolling behavior as bluetooth.

---

**⚡ power profile**

![power popup](assets/power.png)

the border changes color with whatever profile is active.

**📅 calendar**

![calendar](assets/calendar.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>🌻 notifications</summary>
<br>

![notifications](assets/notifications.png)

slide in from the right. each app gets its own accent color derived from the app name — same app always gets the same color. critical notifications go red regardless. a small timer ring drains as the notification ages. hover to pause. click to dismiss.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔑 sddm & lockscreen</summary>
<br>

![sddm theme](assets/sddm.png)

a custom sddm theme built on the same aesthetic so the login screen feels like part of the desktop rather than something bolted on.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧑🏼‍💻 zed theme</summary>
<br>

![zed theme](assets/zed.png)

matches the same color palette. blurred and non-blurred variants included.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🌙 discord theme</summary>
<br>

![discord theme](assets/discord.png)

the discord theme is based on [midnight](https://github.com/refact0r/midnight-discord). i just swapped the colors to match. dont forget to enable transparency in [vesktop](https://vesktop.dev/). (settings -> vencord -> enable window transparency)

</details>

<details>
<summary>🐱 idle screen</summary>
<br>

![idle](assets/idle.png)

a sleeping cat appears after a few minutes of inactivity. dims the screen, breathing animation, animated z's drifting up. any input dismisses it with a fade.

## 📦 extras

i have a [neovim theme](https://github.com/melatonia/nvim) based on the same color palette!

the sound files (login chime, notification, screenshot, usb connect/remove) were made by me in bitwig studio. use them freely, a credit would be appreciated :3

i dont own any of the wallpapers, most of them are just screenshots by me.

i use zen browser with the [transparent zen extension](https://sameerasw.com/zen) and `#212121CC` background. for firefox, [Firefox Gnome Theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme) works well.

<details>
<summary>some usage tips</summary>
<br>

- im open to questions and feature requests, dont hesitate to hit me up on reddit or github (i dont check these places often so if i reply late dont worry)
- for night light to work, you need to set your location in the file (~/.config/mango/scripts/nightlight.sh) (it activates based on time of day, so you might not notice right away, try toggling it at night.)
- you can set your profile picture by just clicking the dashboard area.
- the wallpaper selector reads your "~/Pictures/Wallpapers" folder.
- you can switch between launcher modes with the prefixes. /h for hidden apps, /w for wallpapers, /g for grid-list view switch.
- dashboard and launcher have apps pinning and switcheroo-control support.
- the brightness and audio pills and sliders are scrollable. you can also scroll workspaces by scrolling on the numbers, or super + scroll anywhere.

## 🍀 credits

the popup design language — row style, accent stripes, device selectors — was heavily inspired by [crylia-theme](https://github.com/Crylia/crylia-theme) by [Crylia](https://github.com/Crylia). a beautiful awesomewm rice that made the whole thing feel possible. everything here is reimplemented from scratch in qml, but the soul came from there.

the discord themes are based on [midnight](https://github.com/refact0r/midnight-discord) and [system24](https://github.com/refact0r/system24) by [refact0r](https://www.refact0r.dev), both MIT licensed, with colors adapted to the meloworld palette.

go leave them a star! ⭐
