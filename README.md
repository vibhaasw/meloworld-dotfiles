meloworld is my personal arch linux desktop. i've been working on it for a while now, just trying to fit everything to my taste and build a cozy and safe space out of it. "what is done in love, is done well"

> ⚠️ recently migrated to hyprland. the original mangowm config lives on the [`mangowm`](https://github.com/melatonia/meloworld-dotfiles/tree/mangowm) branch.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎄 launcher</summary>
<br>

![launcher](assets/launcher.png)
![launcher grid](assets/launcher-grid.png)
![clipboard](assets/clipboard.png)
![emoji](assets/emoji.png)
![wallpaper selector](assets/wallpaper-selector.png)

a custom launcher built in quickshell, with modes. aimed to replace rofi for more flexibility. also supports switcheroo-control (like gnome and cosmic). you can switch between modes with the prefixes. /h for hidden apps, /w for wallpapers, /g for grid-list view switch. wallpapers support animated wallpapers and are pulled from ~/Pictures/Wallpapers and ~/Videos/Wallpapers/, just drop yours in.

</details>

<details>
<summary>☀️ dashboard</summary>
<br>

![dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)

a left panel with quick toggles, system stats, and notification history. the greeting changes with the time of day.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🪴 popups</summary>
<br>

all animated — slide down from the top when they open, slide back up when they close. all share the same design language.

**🎼 media player**

![media player](assets/media.png)

supports shuffle and repeat on supported apps. uses the material expressive 3 progress bar. switches between players with arrows. also supports live streams.

---

**🔅 brightness**

![brightness popup](assets/brightness.png)

monitor and keyboard brightness sliders. keyboard slider hides itself if it doesn't have the brightness function.

---

**🔊 audio**

![audio popup](assets/audio.png)

device selection for output and input. volume and mic sliders side by side. click the icon to mute — everything dims when muted. single-device setups hide the selector automatically.

---

**🦷 bluetooth**

![bluetooth popup](assets/bluetooth.png)

paired devices, scan button, filtered scan list, no raw MAC addresses cluttering things up. list caps at five entries and scrolls — tells you when there's more above or below.

---

**🛜 wifi**

![wifi popup](assets/wifi.png)

previously connected networks, autoscan, password entry. same scrolling behavior as bluetooth.

---

**⚡ power profile**

**📅 calendar**

![calendar](assets/calendar.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>🌻 notifications</summary>
<br>

![notifications](assets/notifications.png)

slide in from the right. each app gets its own accent color derived from the app name — same app always gets the same color. critical notifications go red regardless. a small timer ring drains as the notification ages. hover to pause. click to dismiss.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔑 sddm & lockscreen</summary>
<br>

![sddm theme](assets/sddm.png)

a custom sddm theme built on the same aesthetic so the login screen feels like part of the desktop rather than something bolted on.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧑🏼‍💻 zed theme</summary>
<br>

![zed theme](assets/zed.png)

matches the same color palette. blurred and non-blurred variants included.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🌙 discord theme</summary>
<br>

![discord theme](assets/discord.png)

the discord theme is based on [midnight](https://github.com/refact0r/midnight-discord). i just swapped the colors to match. dont forget to enable transparency in [vesktop](https://vesktop.dev/). (settings -> vencord -> enable window transparency)

</details>

<details>
<summary>🐱 idle screen</summary>
<br>

![idle](assets/idle.png)

a sleeping cat appears after a few minutes of inactivity. dims the screen, breathing animation, animated z's drifting up. any input dismisses it with a fade. uses my own idle manager implementation.

    <h3>some usage tips</h3>
  </summary>
  
- im open to questions and feature requests, dont hesitate to hit me up on reddit or github (i dont check these places often so if i reply late dont worry)
- for night light to work, you need to set your location in the file (~/.config/hypr/scripts/nightlight.sh) (it activates based on time of day, so you might not notice right away, try toggling it at night.)
- you can set your profile picture by just clicking the dashboard area.
- the wallpaper selector reads your `~/Pictures/Wallpapers` and `~/Videos/Wallpapers/` folder.
- you can switch between launcher modes with the prefixes. /h for hidden apps, /w for wallpapers, /g for grid-list view switch.
- dashboard and launcher have apps pinning and switcheroo-control support.
- the brightness and audio pills and sliders are scrollable. you can also scroll workspaces by scrolling on the numbers, or super + scroll anywhere.

    <h3>web browser</h3>
  </summary>

i use zen browser with the [transparent zen extension](https://sameerasw.com/zen) and `#212121CC` background. for firefox, [Firefox Gnome Theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme) works well.

</details>

the sound files (login chime, notification, screenshot, usb connect/remove) were made by me in bitwig studio. use them freely, a credit would be appreciated :3

i dont own any of the wallpapers, most of them are just screenshots by me.

## 🍀 credits

the popup design language — row style, accent stripes, device selectors — was heavily inspired by [crylia-theme](https://github.com/Crylia/crylia-theme) by [Crylia](https://github.com/Crylia). a beautiful awesomewm rice that made the whole thing feel possible. everything here is reimplemented from scratch in qml, but the soul came from there.

the discord themes are based on [midnight](https://github.com/refact0r/midnight-discord) and [system24](https://github.com/refact0r/system24) by [refact0r](https://www.refact0r.dev), both MIT licensed, with colors adapted to the meloworld palette.

the zsh prompt is inspired by the [jovial](https://github.com/zthxxx/jovial) theme. aimed to strip away the oh my zsh dependency.

go leave them a star! ⭐
